Simple Access to Powerful Technology
====================================

The idea of CDAP is captured in our phrase, *Simple Access to Powerful Technology*. Our
goal is to provide access to the powerful technology of Apache Hadoop |(R)| through a
unified big data platform for both the cloud and on-premises.

In this introduction to CDAP, we're going to show how CDAP provides that access,
demonstrated through a comparison between using the current technologies available from
the Hadoop ecosystem and using CDAP |---| a new paradigm.

For each example action, we describe a current approach, the steps involved and the
technologies required, and then show an equivalent CDAP command with the resulting output
from the CDAP Command Line Interface. (Output has been reformatted to fit the webpage
as required.)

To try this yourself, :ref:`download a copy of CDAP SDK <standalone-index>`, install it
and then use the resources in its ``examples`` directory as you follow along.

We'll look at these areas:
